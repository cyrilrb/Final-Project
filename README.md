# Machine Learning Demand Forecasting: Avocados

* Most companies that offer products have to make sure that they have enough to satisfy all their customers. It thus becomes important to have a rough estimate of how much preparation would be enough. This estimation can be achieved by what we call, demand forecasting.  A demand forecast is vital for planning all business decisions: sales, finance, production management, logistics and also marketing. If these forecasts are correctly predicted, they can help the businesses grow significantly by allowing them to reach their customers with the right products at the right time. It can also help the businesses in avoiding unnecessary wastage of their resources.
