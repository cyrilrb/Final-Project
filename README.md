# Machine Learning Demand Forecasting: Avocados

* Most companies that offer products have to make sure that they have enough to satisfy all their customers. It thus becomes important to have a rough estimate of how much preparation would be enough. This estimation can be achieved by what we call, demand forecasting.  A demand forecast is vital for planning all business decisions: sales, finance, production management, logistics and also marketing. If these forecasts are correctly predicted, they can help the businesses grow significantly by allowing them to reach their customers with the right products at the right time. It can also help the businesses in avoiding unnecessary wastage of their resources.

* These predictions in demand forecasting can be made through the application of relevant machine learning algorithms. This machine learning project can be implemented by utilizing machine learning algorithms like Bagging, Boosting, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machines, and many more.

# Requirements 

* We used Machine Learning in the context of technologies learned.  As well as Scikit-Learn and/or another machine learning library of our choice.
* We also decided to use Tableau and our choice of Python Pandas or JavaScript D3.js.
* Based on this we used a Google Slides to display our findings by demonstrating a deep dive into machine learning in the context of demand forecasting Avocado quantities/prices in the United States.
